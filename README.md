# 🚀 Asteroids Game – Java 2D (Pure Java, OOP)

A classic Asteroids-style 2D arcade game built entirely in **pure Java**, without using any external game engines.

This project was developed to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming, real-time game loops, collision detection, and event-driven input handling.

## 🎮 Features

- Player-controlled spaceship (keyboard input)
- Real-time game loop
- Asteroid spawning and movement
- Collision detection system
- Score tracking
- Game over state
- Object-oriented architecture

---

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates solid understanding of:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation and class responsibility
- Game loop architecture
- Real-time rendering
- Collision detection algorithms
- Event-driven programming
- Separation of concerns

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular structure:

- **Main/Game class** → Responsible for game initialization and loop control  
- **Player class** → Spaceship logic and movement  
- **Asteroid class** → Asteroid behavior and physics  
- **Collision system** → Hit detection logic  
- **Score/Game State management**

Each class has a single responsibility, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java
- Java AWT / Swing (2D rendering)
- OOP principles

No external frameworks or engines were used.
